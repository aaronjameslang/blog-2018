Drafting is the preliminary stage of a written work in which the author begins to develop a more cohesive product. A draft document is the product the writer creates in the initial stages of the writing process.

In the drafting stage, the author:
- develops a more cohesive text
- organizes thoughts
- explains examples/ideas
- uncovers transitions
- discovers a central argument/point
- elaborates on key ideas
