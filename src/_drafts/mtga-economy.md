# How much do Gems cost?

Ignoring tax

|   Gems |    EUR |    USD | Per 1000 Gems |
|--------|--------|--------|---------------|
|    750 |  4.99€ |  4.99$ |     6.65 ¤/kG |
|  1,600 |  9.99€ |  9.99$ |     6.24 ¤/kG |
|  3,400 | 19.99€ | 19.99$ |     5.88 ¤/kG |
|  9,200 | 49.99€ | 49.99$ |     5.43 ¤/kG |
| 20,000 | 99.99€ | 99.99$ |     5.00 ¤/kG |

It's pretty clear that buying bigger Gem bundles is better value, which is to be expected. 

At current rates 1$ = 0.88€, and 1€ = 1.13$, so will can compare the cost of 20,000 Gems

| buy 20kG with... | Cost in EUR | Cost in USD |
| EUR              |      99.99€ |     113.33$ |
| USD              |      88.22€ |      99.99$ |

This clearly shows that paying in USD is the better deal if it's an option for you, and paying in EUR cost you about a 13% tax.

If you live outside the US and your payment provider charges you a 5% conversion fee for example, it would still be cheaper for you to pay in USD.

> 1000 Gems will cost you 5.00$ - 6.65$ depending on bundle size

# How much do Packs cost?

| Packs |  Coins |    Gems | G/Pack |
|     3 |    N/A |     600 |    200 |
|     6 |    N/A |   1,200 |    200 |
|    15 |    N/A |   3,000 |    200 |
|    45 |    N/A |   9,000 |    200 |
|    90 |    N/A |  18,000 |    200 |

Interestingly, Pack bundles consistenly cost 200G/Pack, so there's no harm in buying Packs 3 at a time.

1 Pack or 200 Gems will cost you 1$ - 1.33$ depending on how you bought your Gems (or up to $1.50 if you insist on paying in EUR).

# How much do Events cost?

...when paying with Gems

Entry costs only, prizes ignored

| Event       | Gems |           USD |
| Draft M19   |  750 | 3.75$ - 4.99$ | 
| Constructed |   95 |   48¢ -   63¢ |
| Singleton   |  100 |   50¢ -   67¢ |

More complete analysis of each Event are available below, including a prize breakdown

# How much are Coins worth?

This is harder to calculate, as you can't buy Coins with $, and you can't buy them with Gems. What we can do, is use the $ prices for Packs and Events above to analyse their cost in Coins.

| Purchase    | Coins |           USD | USD per 1,000 Coins |
| Pack        | 1,000 | 1.00$ - 1.33$ | 1.00$/kC - 1.33$/kC |
| Singleton   |   500 |   50¢ -   67¢ | 1.00$/kC - 1.33$/kC |
| Constructed |   500 |   48¢ -   63¢ |   95¢/kC - 1.26$/kC |
| Draft       | 5,000 | 3.75$ - 5.99$ |   75¢/kC - 1.00$/kC |

What we can see here, is that when buying Packs and entering Singleton events, Coins are valuable, and you're better off spending your coins on these offerings.

However, when entering Draft events, Coins are less valuable, and if you plan to buy Packs or enter other events, you're better off saving your coins and spending Gems on Drafts.

> 1000 Coins are worth 75¢ - 1.33$ depending on how you spend them, and how you buy your Gems

# How much do Events cost, if I spend Coins?

There isn't really a meaningful answer here, as we've calculated the cost of coins based on event costs.
To calculate the cost of events based on coin entry would be circular.

# How much are Prizes worth?

Above we calculated the cost of entering various events, but a more menaingful measure is the net cost considering prize payouts as well.

Here we calculate the payouts in Gems, USD, and finally the net prize by subtracting the entry cost of entry.

## Draft

Entry is 3.75$ - 5.99$

| Wins | Packs | Gems || Eqv. Gems | USD           | Net
|    0 |     1 |   50 ||       250 | 1.25$ - 1.66$ | 
|    1 |     1 |  100 ||       300 | 1.50$ - 2.00$ | 
|    2 |     1 |  200 ||       400 | 2.00$ - 2.66$ | 
|    3 |     1 |  300 ||       500 | 2.50$ - 3.33$ | 
|    4 |     1 |  450 ||       650 | 3.25$ - 4.32$ | 
|    5 |     1 |  650 ||       850 | 4.25$ - 5.65$ | 
|    6 |     1 |  850 ||      1050 | 5.25$ - 6.98$ | 
|    7 |     2 |  950 ||      1350 | 6.75$ - 8.98$ |
