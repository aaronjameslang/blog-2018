Project

Working with and/or being responsible for multiple repos can involve a lot of overhead. This project aim to automate as much of that as possible.

- Discover which individuals or teams code belongs to
- Discover which repos belong to you or your team

  - Consider monorepos, packages may have different owners
  - Will need a way of discovering repos, all in org, all user can see?
  - Will need way of reading repos, can be done without fs access?

- Health-check various repos, check lint is configured right, etc.
