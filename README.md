## Why

I learn best by doing, and remember only by writing. Well, not remember so much, but it's a work-around for the forgetting.

Posts are intended to be useful more than entertaining.

## Development

Runs on [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com), so you'll need ruby, gems, bundle

```shell
# Use ./j to run jekyll
./j --help
# To build, before publishing
./j build
# To serve locally
./j serve --draft
# To create a draft
./j draft
# To promote a draft to a post
./j publish
```
